# ECB_CBC_GCM_Encryption_and_Decryption
I used ECB, CBC, and GCM modes for encryption and decryption of plaintext and ciphertext with a key inputted by the user.
Make sure the key length is 16
ECB mode has the vulnerability of similar ciphertext when similar plaintext is inputted for encryption, and it can be solved by using different keys.
